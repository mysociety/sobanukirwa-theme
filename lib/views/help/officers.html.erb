  <dt id="top">I just got here from bottom of an ATI request, what is going on? <a href="#top">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>Sobanukirwa is a service run by a civil society organisation to help ordinary members
  of the public make access to information (ATI) requests, and easily track and share the responses.</p>

  <p>The ATI request you received was made by someone using Sobanukirwa. You can
  simply reply to the request as you would any other request from an individual.
  The only difference is that your response will be automatically published on
  the Internet.
  </p>
  <p>If you have privacy or other concerns, please read the answers below.
  You might also like to read the <a
  href="<%= help_about_path %>">introduction to Sobanukirwa</a> to find out more about what
  the site does from the point of view of a user. You can also search the
  site to find the authority that you work for, and view the status of
  any requests made using the site.

  <p>Finally, we welcome comments and
  thoughts from information officers, please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">get in touch</a>.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="responses">Why are you publishing responses to ATI requests? <a href="#responses">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>We think there are lots of benefits. Most importantly it will encourage the
  public to be more interested and involved in the work of government. We
  also hope that it will reduce the number of duplicate requests on any
  subject that a public body will receive. Given that access to information
  responses contain public information, which anybody could easily request
  again from the public authority, we think there should be no reason not to
  publish it widely.
  </dd>

  <dt id="realpeople">Are the people making requests real people? <a href="#realpeople">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>Yes. For the purposes of keeping track of responses we use
  computer-generated email addresses for each request. However, before
  they can send a request, each user must register on the site with a
  unique email address that we then verify. You can search this site and
  find a page listing all requests that each person has made.
  </dd>

  <dt id="email_only">An email isn't a sufficient address for an ATI request! <a href="#email_only">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>Yes it is. Rwanda's 2013 access to information law states that information can "be requested by an individual or a group of persons 
  in any of the official languages provided for by the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda verbally, in writing, by telephone, internet 
  or any other means of communication without prejudice to the provisions of this Law".
  </dd>

  <dt id="vexatious">Aren't you making lots of vexatious requests? <a href="#vexatious">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>Sobanukirwa is not making any requests. We are sending requests on
  behalf of our users, who are real people making the requests. </p>
  <p>Look at it like this - if lots of different people made requests from
  different Hotmail email addresses, then you would not think that Microsoft were
  making vexatious requests. It is exactly the same if lots of requests are made
  via Sobanukirwa. Moreover, since all requests are public it is much easier
  for you to see if one of our users is making vexatious requests. </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="spam_problems">I can see a request on Sobanukirwa, but we never got it by email!<a href="#spam_problems">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>If a request appears on the site, then we have attempted to send it to
  the authority by email. Any delivery failure messages will automatically
  appear on the site. You can check the address we're using with the "View ATI
  email address" link which appears on the page for the authority. <a
  href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Contact us</a> if there is a better address we can
  use.</p>
  <p>Requests are sometimes not delivered because they are quietly removed by
  "spam filters" in the IT department of the authority. Authorities can make
  sure this doesn't happen by asking their IT departments to "whitelist"
  any email from <strong>@sobanukirwa.rw</strong>.
  If you <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">ask us</a> we will resend any request,
  and/or give technical details of delivery so an IT department can chase
  up what happened to the message.
  </p>
  <p>Finally, you can respond to any request from your web browser, without
  needing any email, using the "respond to request" link at the bottom of
  each request page.
  </dd>

  <dt id="days">How do you calculate the deadline shown on request pages?<a href="#days">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>
  <p>The access to information law says:</p>

  <blockquote><p>An information officer shall make a decision on a request for information as 
  soon as possible. However, the time limit shall not exceed three working (3) days from the 
  date of receipt of the application.</blockquote>
  
  <p>However, the time may be shortened as follows:</p>
  
  <p>1° where the information sought concerns the life or liberty of a person, the information 
  shall be provided within twenty-four (24) hours from the receipt of the request;</p>

  <p>2° where the information is sought by a journalist for the purposes of news gathering, the 
  information shall be provided within two (2) days from the receipt of the request.</p>
  
  <p>If the information officer wants an extension of the period of time, the law states that "an 
  information officer shall request to the competent organ the extension of the time limit for the 
  provision of information in any of the official languages verbally, in writing and any other means 
  of technology without prejudice to the provisions of Laws".
  </p>
  
  <p>The full text of the law can be found in <a href="http://www.primature.gov.rw/index.php?eID=tx_mm_bccmsbase_zip&id=803869345476cde5d502d">official Gazette no 10 of 11.03.2013</a> 
  on the website of the Office of the Prime Minister.
  </p>
  
  </dd>

  <dt id="days2">But really, how do you calculate the deadline?<a href="#days2">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>

  <p>Please read the answer to the previous question first. Legally, authorities
  must respond <strong>promptly</strong> to ATI requests. If they fail to do that,
  it is best if they show the hard work they are doing by explaining what is
  taking the extra time to do.
  </p>

  </dd>

  <dt id="large_file">How can I send a large file, which won't go by email?<a href="#large_file">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>Instead of email, you can respond to a request directly from your web
  browser, including uploading a file. To do this, choose "respond to request" at
  the bottom of the request's page. <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Contact us</a> if it
  is too big for even that (more than, say, 50Mb).
  </dd>

  <dt id="names">Why do you publish the names of civil servants and the text of emails? <a href="#names">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>We consider what officers or servants do in the course of their employment
  to be public information. We will only remove content in exceptional
  circumstances, see our <a href="<%= help_privacy_path(:anchor => 'takedown') %>">take down policy</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="mobiles">Do you publish email addresses or mobile phone numbers? <a href="#mobiles">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>To prevent spam, we automatically remove most emails and some mobile numbers from
  responses to requests.  Please <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> if we've
  missed one.
  For technical reasons we don't always remove them from attachments, such as certain PDFs.</p>
  <p>If you need to know what an address was that we've removed, please <a
    href="<%= help_contact_path %>">get in touch with us</a>. Occasionally, an email address
  forms an important part of a response and we will post it up in an obscured
  form in an annotation.
  </dd>

  <dt id="copyright"><a id="commercial"></a>What is your policy on copyright of documents?<a href="#copyright">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>The access to information law is "applicant blind", so anyone in the
  world can request the same document and get a copy of it.

  If you think our making a document available on the internet infringes your
  copyright, you may <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">contact us</a> and ask us
  to take it down.  However, to save tax payers' money by preventing duplicate
  requests, and for good public relations, we'd advise you not to do that.
