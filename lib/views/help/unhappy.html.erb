<li>Ask for an <strong>internal review</strong> at the public authority.</li>

    <%= link_to "Request an internal review", new_request_followup_url(:request_id => @info_request.id) + "?internal_review=1#followup", :class => 'link_button_green' %> and then write a message asking the authority to review your request.
<% else %>
    At the bottom of the relevant request page on <%= site_name %> choose
    "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.

<h1 id="complaining">2. Complaining to the Office of the Ombudsman <a class="hover_a" href="#complaining">#</a> </h1>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the public authority has done their internal review,
then you can complain to the Office of the Ombudsman. To do this read
<a href="http://www.ombudsman.gov.rw/?How-to-complain">How to complain</a>
on the Ombudsman's website.
</p>

<p>To make it easier to send the relevant information to the
Office of the Ombudsman, either
<% if !@info_request.nil? %>
    include a link to your request
    <strong><%=h request_url(@info_request) %></strong>
<% else %>
    include a link to your request on <%= site_name %>
<% end %>
in your complaint or print out the whole page of your request and all attachments.
</p>

<p><%= site_name %> has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it
passes into the Ombudsman's system. You can leave annotations on your
request keeping people informed of progress.</p>

<h1 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h1>

<p>You can try persuing your problem or your research in other ways.

<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>new ATI request</strong> for summary information, or for
documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
<a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.</li>
<li>If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned companies are involved,
then make ATI requests to them.</li>
<li>Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this site;
contact any registered user from their page.</li>
</ul>
